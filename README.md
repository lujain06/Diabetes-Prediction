# Diabetes-Prediction
This project uses a data set containing information about diabetes patients to train a neural network clustering algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient with a 99% accuracy rate achieved through the analysis of HbA1c and Blood Glucose Levels. This information can help predict patients at risk of diabetes, allowing doctors to provide early warnings. This project uses 100 data points from the Diabetes Prediction dataset available on Kaggle to train the algorithm, with around 25% of the data points representing diabetic individuals, making the data more applicable to the real world.
